### Guide to Simulating Economic Datasets using WGANs

This repository contains a set of Python functions built on PyTorch for using WGANs to simulate from joint and conditional distributions of economic datasets. 

This [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17E1wnXLktkwc-QAm8X5I42zKgqEEDm95) contains a tutorial for the code, including how to install requirements, and estimate and simulate from the resulting models, using a free Google GPU. The tutorial simulates from the Lalonde-Dehejia-Wahba dataset, as described in detail in the following paper.
